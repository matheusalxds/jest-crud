# POC - Using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) + [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)

#### Project developed to improve knowledge about tests

The project basically consists of:
- Creates connection with database with a db-config file.
- A simple intro module about Jest.
    - Basics about Jest.
    - An Example using mocked function.
- A simple coverage CRUD tests.
    - Creating a connection with database before all tests.
    - Closing the connection after all tests.
    - Cleaning up the created data after each test.

The structure was thinking based on a Real Project System.
